Javascript: I used JS to detect if the user is in a mobile or desktop platform and to enable Bootstrap popovers and tooltips; as well as to implement a light and dark mode toggle, a random cat face emoji generator, a font randomizer, collision detection for dynamically created elements that bounce off the corners of the screen and custom animated cursors.

Bootstrap: I used Bootstrap dropdowns for the menu featured on the navigation bar, popovers and tooltips to display additional information when hovering certain elements, a carousel in order to include a slideshow in the landing page and input groups on the contact pages to allow the user to copy the links found in the text fields to the clipboard with a single click.
